## Who

I am Johnny, Hello!  I'm still trying to discover my role within technology.  It's an ever changing landscape that requires you to be nimble enough to jump across the ever expanding chasms.  I thoroughly enjoy the challenges it provides while also being able to tickle that creative itch.  Sometimes I have the urge to throw my machine out of the window.

I find solace in the bathroom when a problem truly stumps me.  The peace tends to let the answers come to light.

I've been in technology since I was barely walking.  My dad was a punchcard enthusiast for some big entities while my mom built computers in a homegrown business, she later took on a web hosting business during the `dotcom era`.  I helped her out and thats where I began my journey, actionscript, angelfire, and that silliness.  However, I didn't embrace my inner nerd, outside of video games, until later in life.  I wish I had really embraced it sooner.

I ski, game, enjoy some delicious Ciders, and fancy myself a wine connoisseur that doesn't descriminate.  Also food. Yum.

## Why

Blogging is hard.  Finding the time and putting in the effort is far more difficult than I had intented.  Given that I use quite a bit of blogs for answers to obscure questions, I too, would like to be part of that hub.  Let's see.

## What

I’ll write about common practices, programming things, operations, developing, TIL’s, basically, just whatever’s on my mind or I think someone could benefit from the info.
