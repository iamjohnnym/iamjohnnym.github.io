## Who

My name is John but since its so common, I prefer Johnny, an equally common name.  I’ve been playing with technology since the only gui was a command line and you lost a connection when someone picked up the telephone.  I built websites when scrolling marquee was the cheap method of everything Flash.  I break things to understand why things work the way they do, so that I can understand how the pieces fit together.
Where

I started with Linux From Scratch, Gentoo…a few times. I had floppies for days.  I learned how to conjure bash scripts to help my sysadmin role be a bit more tolerable.  I wanted to be a developer so I learned PHP and all of its treachery.  I learned how to write and debug complex SQL statements while also learning how to get the most out of tuning configs and schemas.  I wanted more from programming so I learned python, then rails, lua, and some others.  Automation became life though, Ansible has a special place in my heart, Salt Stack isn’t bad when done correctly, but I’m still learning how to cook with Chef.

I worked on an ambulance of awhile; that was wild.

I ski.
## Why

I want to write more and I enjoy educating where I can.  I’ve always seemed to find some obscure websites have the answer’s I may need.  Why not keep the sequence going?
## What

I’ll write about common practices, programming things, operations, developing, TIL’s, basically, just whatever’s on my mind or I think someone could benefit from the info.
